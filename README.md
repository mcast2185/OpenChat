# OpenChat Application

> Although I captured the idea of this app from a tutorial I choose to reword and rework some of the code to make it feel my own.
> The main goal of this was to open my eyes to different platforms that could be useful to me in later projects, such as chatengine and firebase.
> This project should be the accessibility I have the power to use by signing up as a developer for apps like facebook, twitter and youtube.

*ReactJS, Firebase, ChatEngine, developer portals (facebook)*
